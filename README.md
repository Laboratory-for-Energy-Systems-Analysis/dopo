## About dopo
The **Premise Validation Project** introduces the Python package ``dopo`` 
(**D**etecting **O**utliers in **P**remise **O**perations), an outlier 
detection framework for ``premise``-based and scenario-based 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) databases.

``dopo`` visualizes and compares LCA datasets by sector and 
characterization methods, generating three types of plots and 
detailed tables. It allows quick comparison between the examined 
database and the original *ecoinvent* database, with results exported 
to an Excel workbook for easy analysis.

The goal of dopo is to streamline outlier detection, enabling users 
to quickly identify anomalies and understand their impact on LCA results. 
Additionally, dopo can visualize entire databases or any other 
databases used in Brightway.
